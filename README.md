# Parrot

## Objectives
1. Define a method that accepts arguments.
2. Create a default argument.
3. Practice returning a value.

##Instructions

In this lab you'll be defining a method called `parrot`. When you pass `parrot` a string argument containing a phrase, the method should both output that phrase and return the phrase. 

The `parrot` method should have a default phrase of "Squawk!" 

**Note:** *This lab is explicitly testing your ability to control the return value of a method, not just what it does, but what it returns. Remember, return values are important.*
